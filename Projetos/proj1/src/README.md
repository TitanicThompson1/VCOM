# Traffic Sign Detection

The goal of this project is to build an application capable of recognize and classify traffic signs, detecting a subset of the traffic signs used in Portugal and group them into one of the 3 classes: stop sign, red circles and blue squares. 

To run the program developed, you must run the main file and give a path to an image. 
```bash
python main.py 'dataset/formatted_images/sp_cw_95.png'
```
For example, when running the command above we obtain the next result.

It is also possible to test efficiency of every class detection running the following command
```bash
python efficiency_test.py
```
